Your loan request has been refused - discover our other solutions

<p>Thank you for your loan application. Unfortunately, after reviewing the provided data, your current status does not allow us to make an offer. In case there is a change in your situation, please do not hesitate to contact us again or submit an online request. It is always free and without obligation.</p>
<p>We also advise you to avoid making too many requests elsewhere, as each application is recorded at the banking credit record system (ZEK/IKO). An accumulation of too many refusals will result in a negative rating for future requests, even with an improvement in your status. </p>
<p>We recommend that you wait a minimum of three months (and a possible change in your financial situation) to make a new credit application.</p>
