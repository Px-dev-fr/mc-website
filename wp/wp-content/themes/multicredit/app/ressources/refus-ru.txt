<br>
<br>Thank you for your loan application. Unfortunately, after analysis, your budget is not good enough to get the wished amount. If your budget situation should change, do not hesitate to visit us again to make us a Â new request: it is always free and without obligation.
<br>
<br>We also advise you to avoid making too many demands elsewhere. Indeed, each application is recorded at the center. An accumulation of too many refusals will result in a negative rating for future requests, even with an improvement in your budget.
<br>
<br>That is why we recommend that you wait a minimum of three months (and a possible change in your financial situation) to make a new credit application.
<br>
