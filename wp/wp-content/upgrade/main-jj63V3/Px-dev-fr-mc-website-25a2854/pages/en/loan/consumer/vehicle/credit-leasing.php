		<p>Are you looking for a new car, motorbike, or any vehicle? Basically, you have two financial possibilities: credit or leasing. Both solutions can be interesting, and it is important to make the right choice according to your needs and budget.</p>
		
		<h2>Leasing</h2>
		<p>This method is common but not always optimal. When you take your vehicle in leasing you have some incoveniences: The vehicle doesn't belong to you. It's like hiring it.</p>
		
		<h2>A loan</h2>
		<p>When you take a loan, your first advantage is that the vehicle belongs to you. So you don't have to worry about the kilometers and can <b>choose the insurance freely</b>.</p>
		
		<h2>The cost</h2>
		<p>Let's take for example a <b>10,000 Chf new car</b>. Buying it with a loan over a repayment period of 12 months will cost you 10'650 Chf only. That means <b>only 650 Chf of interest</b>. When you are taking a leasing, you pay overall the cost of depreciation of the vehicle. This cost can be sometimes more important than a credit (depending on your contract and options). Also, once your leasing contract finished, you are not the owner of the vehicle (or you must pay to be it).</p>
		
		<h2>Compare offers</h2>
		<p>Before you sign up for any solution, the best thing to do is to compare offers. At Multicredit, we can make you a free vehicle loan offer. This is <b>free of charge</b> and <b>does not commit you</b> to anything. That means the offer will be available one full month to give you enough time to compare with a leasing offer for example.</p>
