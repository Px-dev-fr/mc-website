		<p>When speaking of loan, the credit interest represents the total cost of the loan. Basically, this <b>credit interest</b> depends of two main factors:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The <b>interest rate of the loan</b>: the higher the interest rate is, the more you will pay</li>
			<li>The <b>duration of the credit</b>: a short repayment duration will be much less expensive than a long period</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>What is a good credit interest?</h2>
		<p>A personal credit comes with a rate generally varying between 7.9% to 13.5%. Banks set the interest according to the situation of everyong requesting a loan. The best is your financial situation, the lower interest rate you will be offered for a loan.</p>
		<h2>How to calculate the cost of the loan?</h2>
		<p>The <strong>credit interest</strong> is actually an annual one. That means the calculation of the cost is not so easy. Let's take for example a 12-months repayment of a 10'000 Chf loan, with an <strong>credit interest rate</strong> of 10%. Each month, you will pay interests over this loan. That means that each month, the sum you'll have to repay will be lower, and the interest will decrease. <p>In general, this reasoning explains why, for a loan of 10,000 CHF over a year, you pay in the end <b>only 650 Chf of credit interest</b> in total. It can be quite difficult to calculate a credit rate.</p>
		<h2>The the total cost</h2>
		<p>Therefore we advise our customers, rather tan being interested at the interest rate, to check the total cost of the credit. This information is much more valuable and makes things <b>easier to compare</b>.</p>
