		<p>The solvency is an indicator for evaluating the ability of someone to repay a loan. Each bank has its own way to evaluate the creditworthiness of its customers. However, we will explain here the basis to calculate your <b>credit solvency</b>.</p>
		<h2>What is the criteria of credit solvencyÂ ?</h2>
		<p>The <strong>credit solvency</strong> of a person depends of course on its financial position, but not only. In fact, <strong>credit solvency</strong> depends on:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Income</b>: indeed, the higher the monthly income of an individual is, the higher its rating will be considered "good".</li>
			<li><b>Expenses</b>: having high income is not sufficient to be considered "creditworthy". It should also not have to much spending, relative to your income.</li>
			<li><b>Job stability</b>: generally, an employee who has worked in the same company for many yers has more chances to get a credit than someone who changed all the time.</li>
			<li><b>Family situation</b>: this factor, little known a priori, is yet so real. A family man, married with children, will often be better considered by banks (in the case of a credit application), than a single mother for example. For that reason, credit agencies need to know your marital status.</li>
			<li><b>The antecedents</b>: a person who already has a credit history (without any problem) will be considered better than someone whose loan is the first one.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Credit solvency and loan application</h2>
		<p>More you will be considered a solvent person, most likely you are to see your loan application accepted. Furthermore, in case of acceptance, you will be able <b>to get better conditions</b> with a good credit solvency.</p>
