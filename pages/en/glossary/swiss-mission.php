	<p>The Swiss Mission, also called <b>the Permanent Mission of Switzerland to the UN and to the other international organisations</b> (The WTO and the European Free Trade Association) manages the status of international organisations. It is also in charge of representing their employees and families.</p>
	<h2>Two permanent Missions:</h2>
	<p>Switzerland is represented in Geneva by two permanent Missions:</p>
	<ul> 
		<li>The Mission to the United Nations Office and to the other international organisations</li>
		<li>The Mission to the World Trade Organisation and the European Free Trade Association.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Main responsibilities:</h2>
	<p>The permanent Mission of Switzerland to the UN and to the other international organisations performs diplomatic tasks in order to <b>represent Switzerland's interests</b>. It is also active in the area of humanitarian issues and human rights. As a representative of the international organisations' employees and their families, the Mission is responsible for delivering <b>legitimation cards</b> of the FDFA (Federal Department of Foreign Affairs).</p>
	<h2>Obtaining a legitimation card from the Mission</h2>
	<p>Via the Swiss Mission, the members of the international organisations based in Switzerland receive a legitimation card that entitles the holder <b>to live in and to come to Switerland</b> (without visa). Financially, this card usually allows its owner to obtain a credit in Switzerland <b>on the same terms as holders of a C permit</b>.<p>
	<h2>Certificate and cards' renewal</h2>
	<p>If the legitimation card should expire soon, banks can ask any clients making a credit request either a certificate (stating that the card is being renewed) or to wait for the card's renewal. The employer must make the administrative procedures (usually the NGO or embassy) but the certificate will be delivered by <b>the Swiss Mission</b>.</p>
	<p>Do you have any questions? Do you wish to obtain a credit with a legitimation card delivered by the Swiss Mission? Do not hesitate to contact us to get a free offer without commitment!<p>
