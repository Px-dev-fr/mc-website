	<p>We can help you get a <b>tailored mortgage credit</b> for your new house! In Switzerland, the best way to finance your home purchase, renovations or building is to make a mortgage credit. A personal loan amount is limited to 300,000 Chf, but a mortgage credit will give you the possibility to fund the house of your dreams with a much more <b>flexible amount</b>!</p>
